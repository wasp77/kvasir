# Description

This is meant to be a from scratch implementation of a (decoder only) transformer model. My aim is to write everything from scratch ideally only using numpy. I first want to write it in as simple code as possible with no thought of performance and then maybe go back and optimize.

# Disclaimers

I know the abstractions are all over the place. This isn't an exercise in creating a new framework. Instead, this is purely to see if I could get something working.
